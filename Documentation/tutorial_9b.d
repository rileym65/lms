[c]	Starting from the Moon
[=]
	This short tutorial will show you how to setup the simulator for a
	Lunar landing starting in Lunar orbit.  This is to prepare you for
	tutorial 9, which shows how to land on the Moon from Lunar orbit.
[=]
	To begin make sure you do not currently have a lms.sav file.  If this
	file exists then the simulator will load it rather than allowing you
	to create a new simulation.
[=]
	1. Start the simulator and you will be presented with a short menu
	of options for starting the simulation.  Select option '2' to start
	from the Moon.
[=]
	2. Next you will be given a list of spacecraft to fly.  Select option
	'2', the Apollo-J.  The landing tutorial assumes this spacecraft is the
	one being flown.
[=]
	3. Next you will be asked for a 'Target Longitude', this is the longitude
	of your desired landing site.  We will setup to use the Apollo 11 landing
	site as our target, so enter 23.47.
[=]
	4. Next you will be asked for the 'Target Latitude'.  The latitude of
	the Apollo 11 landing site is 0.67n, so enter 0.67.
[=]
	5. Next you will be asked for 'CSM Longitude Ascending Node'.  This is
	the point in the orbit where the CSM crosses from the southern hemisphere
	to the northern.  For the simplest in-plane landing at the Apollo 11
	landing site we want to set the LAN 90 degrees East of the landing site.
	Since the landing site is 23.47 degrees East, the LAN needs to be at
	113.47 degrees East, so enter 113.47.
[=]
	6. And last you will be asked for 'CSM Inclination'.  This is the inclination
	of our orbit relative to the Lunar Equator.  For the simplest in-plane landing
	we want to set this to the same as our target latitude, so set 0.67 here.
[=]
	Now you will be taken into the simulator in orbit of the Moon.  When starting
	from the Moon the simulator uses a greatly simplified CSM.  This CSM cannot
	be maneuvered, it will be oriented already as described in tutorial 9, so you
	will not need to perform this step yourself.
[=]
	The simplified CSM also uses a different version of the guidance computer and
	so the commands used to set computer modes in tutorial 9 cannot be used.
	When asked to set V16N12 in the tutorial, just press the <2> key and the
	simplified guidance computer will be in a mode where you get your position
	relative to the landing site as needed in the tutorial.
[=]
	At this point go back to tutorial 9 and good luck on your landing!
