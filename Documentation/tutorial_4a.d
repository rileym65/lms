[c]	Spacecraft Orientation
[=]
	In this tutorial we are going to go over spacecraft orientation.
	In order to be able to go anywhere it is important know how to
	orient, or point, your spacecraft in the correct direction.  This
	tutorial assumes that you have read part 1 of tutorial 4 which
	describes the multi-axis display that will be the core instrument
	for spacecraft orientation.  This tutorial also assumes that you
	are in a stable orbit and no longer connected to the launch
	vehicle.

	We will start by using the absolute mode of the multi-axis display.
	press the <[> or <]> key until you are in the absolute mode.  We will
	start in this mode since it has a stable reference vector that does
	not change as we orbit around the Earth.  While first learning how
	to orient the spacecraft, we do not want to have to be chasing a
	moving target.
[=]
	Before we try to orient the spacecraft lets go over the orientation
	controls.  As has been stated in prior tutorials the spacecraft
	has three primary face, F-forward, U-Up, and L-Left.  Each of these
	faces represent one of the 3 axis of the spacecraft.  The Up face
	is on the roll axis, the F face is on the yaw axis and the L face
	is on the pitch axis.
[=]
	When you use any of the rotation thrusters you change the rotation
	rate around a particular axis, so for example if you use the pitch
	thrusters the spacecrat will rotate around the L face, or the L
	face will stay stationary and the F and U faces will move.  This
	is true of all the rotation thrusters.  With the roll thrusters the
	U face will stay stationary and the F and L faces will move, and
	with the yaw thrusters the F face will stay stationary and the U
	and L faces will move.
[=]
	The sample display I show here is the orientation that I will be
	working with, yours will likely be different, but the techniques I
	will explain will allow you to orient your spacecraft.
[=]
	In my sample none of the faces are directly on one of the two
	crosshairs of the multi-axis display, but ultimately I want all
	three faces to be aligned on the refrence axis.  If one of your
	faces (does not matter which one) is already on one of the reference
	lines you can go ahead to the next stop, otherwise continue with
	this one.
[=]
	You want to take the face that is closes to a centerline, in my
	case it is the F face.  You will use the rotation controls around
	this face to move the other two.  Since for me the F face is the
	one I will be rotating around, I will be using the yaw controls
	<keypad 4> and <keypad 6>.  If your closest face is U then you will
	use the rotation controls <keypad 7> and <keypad 9> or if the L
	face is closest you will use the pitch controls <keypad 8> and
	<keypad 2>.

	By rotating around your selected axis you should be able to bring
	one, and likely both of the other axis onto the centerlines.  Once
	you have accomplished this stop all rotation.
[=]
	In my case I was able to bring both the L and U faces onto the 
	centerlines with my yaw rotation.  If you are not able to get two
	faces centered, that is ok, you just need to perform an extra 
	rotation.
[=]
	Now you want to rotate around one of the faces that is on a
	center line in order to bring another face to a centerline.  In my
	sample the F face is still not on any centerline.  Since the F is
	not on either centerline and both my L and U faces are on centerlines
	I can choose either the L or U faces to rotate around to bring the
	F to one of the centerlines.  If you only have one face on a
	centerline then that is the face you must rotate around to bring
	another face to center.
[=]
	In my case I will choose to use the pitch controls to rotate around
	the L axis to bring my F face up the the Z centerline.

	At this point all of my faces are now on centerlines, but we are
	still not aligned with the reference axis.  The F face is off-center.
	To be aligned with the reference axis the F that is in the center
	section of the display must be on both the Y and Z centerlines.
[=]
	To center the F face I will need to now rotate around my U face, or
	in other words, use the roll controls.

	Now after a small roll of the spacecraft my spacraft is now aligned
	with the reference vector.  In my sample here it is the F face that
	is aligned with the reference vector and the U and L faces are 90
	degrees to it.  From here it is a simple matter of rotating around
	any of the three faces in order to align any face in any direction.
[=]
	So a quick recap on getting to a fixed orientation:
[=]
[lb12]
[li]	Rotate around the face nearest to a centerline in order to get one
	or both of the other faces to a centerline.
[li]	Using a face on a centerline rotate around the aligned face to
	get one or more other faces to centerlines
[li]	Once all three faces are on centerlines, then rotate whichever
	edge face is needed to bring the center face to the exact center
	of the multi-axis display.
[le]
[=]
	This is a good mode to just practice using your rotation thrusters.
	Try changing your orientation so that the Up face is centered on
	the display, or towards other edges.  Be sure you are comfortable
	orienting your spacecraft in this mode before we go on to the
	moving target mode of Prograde mode.

	+-------------------------+
[ee]
	Now lets switch to the prograde mode, press the <[> key until you
	get to this mode.  Unlike the absolute mode, this mode has a moving
	reference vector.  To see this, turn on time compression and watch
	this display.  There are two things you should take note of, first
	is that the faces only move up and down, there is no left or right
	movement of the faces, and second, the closer to the left and right
	edges of the display the less that face moves.  In my example here
	the L face does not move very far from the horizontal centerline.
[=]
	This gives us two very useful traits of the prograde mode, first
	is that if a face is on the vertical centerline, it will always
	be on the centerline, and second, a face that is at the extreme
	left or the extreme right will be in a stable position that does
	not move.  These two traits will help us align the spacecraft.
[e-]
[=]
	Before continuing with prograde alignment I want to give one more
	analogy that will help you understand exactly what this mode is
	showing you and will also help you to visualize your orbit.  Imagine
	you are in a car travelling down a long straight road, the path
	down the road is your prograde direction and is also the reference
	vector for the prograde mode of the multi-axis display.  Now 
	consider your head and eyes to be the Up face, you can look in any
	direction, just like the spacecraft's Up face can face any direction
	irregardless of the direction of travel.
[=]
	When you are looking directly forward at the road and directly at
	the horizon then you are looking in the precise prograde direction
	which on the display will appear as a 'u' in the exact center of
	the display.  Now if you turn your head to the right so that you
	are looking to the right of the road, on the display this would
	move the 'u' towards the right of the display.  Looking to the
	right is looking towards the "normal" of your orbit.  By turning
	your head to the left to look at what is on the left side of the
	road, this moves the 'u' towards the left side of the display or
	towards the "anti-normal" of your orbit.
[=]
	Now with your head again looking straight forward at the horizon,
	now look down, as if you were trying to look at what is underground
	this moves the 'u' down on the dislay, towards the "inside" of your
	orbit, think if this as trying to look inside the Earth.  Now move
	your head to look at the sky, this moves the 'u' upwards on the
	display, towards the "outside" of the orbit, think of this as looking
	outside of the Earth.
[=]
	With these visualizations the prograde mode should now make perfect
	sense exactly what it is showing you.  Because most maneuvers are
	made with the main engine, the U face is generally the most important
	face with its position on the panel, just think of the U face as
	being where you were looking in the imaginary car travelling down
	the road.
[=]
	Now it is time to orient our spacecraft in prograde mode.  Since
	many maneuvers are made with the spacecraft oriented prograde, we
	will first learn how to orient prograde.  Just like in absolute
	mode, we want to get all the faces onto centerlines.  But
	remember that in prograde mode only the vertical centerline is stable,
	once you have a face on the vertical centerline it will stay on the
	centerline even tho it will still move up and down on the display.
	So you want to start by getting at least 1 face onto the vertical
	centerline.  If you already have one face on the vertical centerline
	then just go on to the next step, otherwise just as in the absolute
	mode, pick the face that is the closest to the vertical center and
	that is the face you need to rotate around.  In my sample, my F
	face is the closes to the vertical center so I will be using yaw
	controls to bring my U face to the center.
[=]
	One note while doing this.  Ideally you want the L face to be towards
	the left or right edge of the display, I will explain why shortly.
	So when determining a closes face to the vertical center ignore the
	L face and only use the F and U faces.  Even if the L is already on
	the vertical center, still ignore it and align using the U and F
	faces.

	Once you have one face on the vertical center, now you can rotate
	around that face to bring the next one to center.  So in my case
	the Up face is on the vertical center so I will now use roll controls
	to move the F face to the center.

	Once you have both the F and U faces on the vertical center, the L
	face should be on or very close to the horizontal center and towards
	the far left or right edges of the display.
[=]
	Even tho this display makes it look like all my faces are on centers,
	they are still actually slightly off, so there is still a little
	work to do, but we will not be able to get it any closer using only
	multi-axis display.

	| L:    2.10   -86.78  -  |
	+-------------------------+
[ee]
	We will need to look at the precision prograde panel to get our
	alignment closer.
[=]
	On this panel you need to look at the 'Norm' column for the U and
	F faces and the "Elev" column for the L face.  This is showing me
	that my faces are between 2 and 2.5 degrees away from being centered.
[=]
	When working with smaller angles it will help to throttle down your
	rotation thrusters.  Medium throttle will make 0.5 degree/second
	changes and low throttle will make 0.1 degree/second changes.
[=]
	I will start by rotating around my U face using roll controls to
	move my F face as close to center as possible.

	| L:   -0.39   -87.99  -  |
	+-------------------------+
[ee]
	Now my F face is as close to center as I can get it with low
	thrusters.  Now I need to rotate around my F face using yaw
	controls to move my U face closer to center.

	| L:    0.01   -89.98  -  |
	+-------------------------+
[ee]
	Now my U face is as close to center as I can get it.  Also note
	that my L face is also just about on center.  I did not actually
	have to concern myself with the L face, just by getting your F and
	U faces properly aligned will automatically make your L face be
	in alignment.
[=]
	At this point the spacecraft is aligned with the prograde related
	vectors, but it is important to note that I am not actually aligned
	prograde, but now it is an easy matter of pitch adjustments to 
	align the spacecraft prograde or retrograde.
[=]
	Now in my sample I aligned the spacecraft with the L face to the
	left of the display.  The reason that I did that is so that pitch
	controls will seem more natural to me.  When flying an airplane
	pitching forward points you more towards the ground.  In the
	spacecraft with the L towards the left, pitching forward will point
	more towards the ground.  If the L was on the other side, then
	pitching forward would point you away from the ground, and for an
	airplane pilot that is just not natural!  Although you can put your
	L face on either side, I recommend you put it on the left like I
	do.  All my tutorials that mention pitch adjustments will assume
	that the L face is to the left and that pitching forward will angle
	you more towards the ground.

	Now that the spacecraft is aligned on the prograde related vectors,
	lets now start looking at the various alignements used for 
	maneuvering.  We will start with orienting prograde.  A prograde
	orientation is required for LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion), EOI (Earth
	Orbit Insertion) and for raising an orbit using a Hohmann transfer.
[=]
	A spacecraft is considered oriented prograde when the U face is
	centered on the prograde display and is in lowercase 'u'.  Just
	as before you can use the multi-axis display for getting close
	to the correct alignment, but you will still need to use the 
	precision prograde panel to be more precise.

	| F:   89.98     0.01  +  |
	| L:    0.01   -89.98  -  |
	+-------------------------+
[ee]
	On the precision prograde panel the only face you really care about
	for prograde orientation is the U face.  Both the Elev and Norm
	columns must be near zero and the third column must have a '+'
	symbol.  This sample shows that my spacecraft is oriented prograde
	and ready to perform any maneuver requiring prograde orientation.
[=]
	Note that the Elev will constantly be changing as you orbit around
	the body so constant adjustment to pitch will be required to maintain
	prograde orientation.  All maneuvers requiring prograde orientation
	will require you to maintain prograde orientation throughout the
	entire maneuver, for example, the LOI burn lasts just over 6 minutes,
	for that entire time you must be constantly adjusting pitch to
	maintain prograde orientation.

	The next orientation to look at is retrograde orientation.  In this
	orientation the U face is faceing away from the direction of flight
	and is required for maneuvers that require you to slow down, like
	LOI (Lunar Orbit Insertion) or lowering an orbit with a Hohmann
	transfer.  In the LM retrograde orientation is also used for DOI
	(Descent Orbit Insertion) and PDI (Powered Descent Initiation).
[=]
	When you are oriented retrograde the multi-axis display will appear
	as in my sample with the U face centered and now in uppercase 'U'.
	Note that the L face is still to the left but now the F face is
	facing downwards.  To get here from the prograde orientation needs
	nothing more than adjusting your pitch to rotate the spacecraft
	180 degrees.

	Like when orienting prograde, using only the multi-axis display
	will get you close but not precise, so again once the multi-axis
	display shows you oriented retrograde, you will need to check the
	precision prograde panel to be more precise.

	Here is what the precision prograde panel should look like when
	you are properly oriented retrograde.  Again you are really only
	interested in the U face, both Elev and Norm need to be near zero
	and this time in the third column you will have a '-' sign.
[=]
	Just like when oriented prograde, you will need to make constant
	adjustments to pitch in order to maintain proper retrograde
	orientation.

	Two other quick orientations are inside and outside orientations,
	which are mainly used for course corrections.  They are like
	prograde or retrograde except instead of the Up face being centered
	in the display it will be at the top of the display for outside
	orientation and at the bottom for inside orientation.  From the
	base orientation it is just a matter of pitch change to achieve
	these two orientations.

	The next orientation to look at is the "Orbit Normal" orientation.
	This orientation is used during plane change maneuvers.  In this
	orientation you move the Up face to the Norm side of the display,
	which puts the Up face in the stable position, to maintain the
	directions of the other two faces now requires roll instead of
	pitch.  
[=]
	The easiest way to get into this oriention is to start from either
	the prograde or retrograde orientations (Up face in the center)
	and then yaw around the F face.
[=]
	Although it is not necessary to have the L or F faces aligned in
	any partcular direction to maintain an Orbit Normal orientation,
	plane change maneuvers will require that either the L or F face
	be in the center of the display, so may as well practice keeping
	a face there.

	Here is what the precision prograde panel looks like while in an
	Orbit Normal orientation.  The Up face will have an elevation near
	zero and a Norm near 90, the + or - does not matter here.  Whichever
	face you choose to be centered (L in my sample) will have both Elev
	and Norm near zero.

	The last important orientation is the Orbit Anti-normal orientation.
	and is similar to the Orbit Normal except now the Up face will be
	to the far left of the panel.  The precision prograde panel will
	be near -90 for the Up face normal.  Like Orbit Normal, this 
	orientation is used for plane change maneuvers.

	At this point you should now be able to put the spacecraft into
	the main orientations that are used for a lunar mission.  The next
	portion of this tutorial will go into the actual orbital maneuvers.
