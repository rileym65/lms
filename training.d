[c]	=======================

	LMS is a complicated program with a fairly steep learning curve.  It is 
	recommended that you go through this training series before attempting your
	first landing.  This training series will familiarize you with all the
	various controls of the spacecraft as well as how to perform essential
	maneuvers.
[=]
	The lessons in this training course assume that you are using the advanced
	instrument panels and the guidance computer instead of the INS display.  If
	you are using the AMS panel or the INS instead of the guidance computer then
	you will need to translate some if the information provided in these tutorials.

[h2]	Lesson 1
	In this first lession we will transfer to the LM and undock, move about 100
	meters north of the CSM and then approach and dock.
[=]
	Remove or rename any lms.sav file that may be in your game directory.  We will
	want to start out with a fresh game.
[=]
	Upon starting LMS, you will be asked for a target landing site.  Since we will
	not be landing in this lesson, the values here are irrelevent, you can just enter
	0 for both the latitude and longitude.
[=]
	After specifying the landing site, you will find yourself in the CMS.  As the CSM
	is not controllable in this simulation, there are very few instruments on the panel.
	A large orbital map will be displayed on the left of the screen, the current time
	in UTC will appear near the top on the right and the INS display will appear in the
	middle of the right panel.
[=]
	Ordinarily you would use the data from the INS to decide when to transfer to the
	LM, since we are not attempting a landing in this lesson, we can transfer to the
	LM at any time.  Go ahead and press the <M> key to transfer to the LM.  A message
	will appear in the message window showing that we are moving to the LM and how
	many seconds this will take to complete.  You can press <shift><5> to speed this up.
[=]
	After the move is complete you will be looking at the LM instrument panel.  The
	LM instrument panel contains a lot of information, but we only need to look at a
	couple of the instruments for now.

	Lets start by looking at the pilot information panel.  This is located on the 
	lower right corner of the instrument panel.  This instruments shows the metabolic
	information for the pilot.  the MB value shows the current Metabolic Rate of the
	pilot.  The higher this number the faster your heart is beating.  A high
	metabolic rate has a negative impact on efficiency, so it is a good idea to keep
	this number as low as possible.  When we moved from the CSM to the LM we had
	some physical exertion, this is why the metabolic rate has risen from its base
	rate of 30.  The metabolic rate will decrease over time so long as you are not
	performing any strenuous tasks.
[=]
	The EF indicator shows the efficiency of the pilot.  The higher this number the
	more efficient the pilot is at performing tasks.  This number will get smaller
	with a higher metabolic rate or increased injury.  The lower this number is the
	longer it takes for the pilot to perform a task.  So with a high efficiency, the
	simulator will respond quickly to your keypresses, when efficiency is low then
	it takes longer for your key presses to be performed.  Try to avoid time critical
	tasks while your efficiency is low.
[=]
	IN represents total pilot injury.  There are actually two injury values, hard 
	injury represents injuries sustained by the pilot from a hard landing or moving
	too quickly over rough lurrain.  Soft injury is increased while the pilot is awake
	and is used to simulate fatique from lack of sleep.  Sleeping will reduce soft
	injury.  The value shown in IN represents the accumulation of both hard and soft
	injury.  The higher the injury value, the lower your efficiency becomes.  So 
	remember to sleep each day to reset your soft injury.  Hard injuries will stay
	with you throughout the rest of the simulation, so you should try to avoid those.
[=]
	Next below the metabolic information we see the letters LM, this tells us that the
	pilot is currently located in the LM.
[=]
	The last value in this instrument is RK, which shows how many kilograms of samples
	have been loaded onto the LM.
