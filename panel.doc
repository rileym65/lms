Ams_Attitude

  This guage displays more accurate attitude information than     +-------+
what can be seen from the axis displays. u/r shows the relation-  |    att|
ship between the Up face and the lunar radial.  An indicator of   |u/r: 56|
0 would indicate that the Up face is pointing directly away from  |f/r: 34|
the lunar surface, while 180 would indicate the Up face is point- |l/s:  0|
ing directly at the lunar surface.  f/r shows the same type of    +-------+
relationship for the front face in relation to the ground.  l/s gives the
angle between the left face and the lunar south pole.  An indicator of 0
would indicate that the left face is pointing directly south, while an
indicator of 180 would indicate that the left face was pointing north.


Ams_Clocks
                                                             +------------+
  This gauge displays important mission clocks.  UT shows    |      clocks|
current universal time.  MI shows the current Mission        |UT: 10:41:36|
elapsed time.  BU shows either the current burn time of the  |MI:  1:30:24|
ascent or descent engine if either of these is currently     |BU:  0:01:03|
operating, otherwise it shows how long the last burn lasted. |EV:  0:00:00|
The BU clock is reset each time the ascent or descent engine |DK:  0:00:00|
is ignited.  EV shows the duration of the current EVA if an  |OR:  1:53:59|
EVA is currently in progress, otherwise it shows how long    +------------+
the last EVA lasted.  The EV clock will reset at the beginning of each EVA.
The DK clock shows how long it has been since lifting off from the lunar
surface.  The OR clocks shows how long 1 orbit takes.  The INS must be set
to any of the ORB modes for this clock to show an accurate time.


Ams_Consumables

  This gauge shows the levels of the various LM consumables.  ASC +-------+
shows the percentage of remaining ascent fuel.  If the ascent     | consum|
engine is currently running than a ^ flag will be shown just to   | ASC:99|
the left of ASC.  RCS shows the remaining percentage of RCS fuel. | RCS:95|
Just to the left the RCS label three possible flags could be      | DES:99|
shown.  A '^' flag indicates that the RCS throttle is currently   | THR: 0|
set to high, a 'v' flag indicates that the RCS throttle is        | OXY:98|
currently set to low, while a ' ' flag indicates that the RCS     | BAT:98|
throttle is set to medium.  DES shows the remaining percentage    +-------+
of descent fuel.  If the descent stage has been jettisoned then this
inidcator will show '**' for the remaining fuel.  If the descent engine is
currently running then a '^' flag will be shown to the left of this 
indicator.  THR shows the current descent engine throttle setting.  If the
descent stage has been jettisoned then this indicator will show '**'.
OXY shows the remaining percentage of oxygen and BAT shows the remaining
percentage of the battery.


Ams_DockingRadar

  The docking radar will show you your alignment to the     +-------------+
docking port on the CSM.  This gauge will only show data    |    dock     |
when the LM is within 200m of the CSM and the docking       | +---f|--^-+ |
radar is on.  The 'v' and '^' that appear towards the top   | +    v    + |
and bottom of the gauge indicate your roll alignment.  When | |         |l|
both of these indicators are centered then the LM is rolled |--    *    --|
to the correct angle.  The pitch/yaw angles are depicted    |r|         | |
on the guage with a 'X' symbol.  When the 'X' symbol is     | <    ^    > |
centered then the LM pitch and yaw are correctly aligned.   | +----|b-v-+ |
The horizontal and vertial position of the LM to the CSM    +-------------+
are depicted with a '+' symbol.  When the '+' symbol is centered then the
LM is correctly positioned to dock.  If the '+' symbol and the 'X' occupy
the same position on the radar display then a '*' will be shown.  When
there is a '*' symbol in the center of display then the LM is correctly
positioned and pitch/yaw aligned with the CSM.  There are also several
symbols that can appear on the display frame.  Near the top on the left
and right edges, if a '-' symbol appears then you are either moving away
from the docking port or you are moving too slowly for a successful 
docking.  If a '+' symbol appears in this area then your closing speed
is too fast for a successful docking.  if in this area you see the usual
'|' symbol for the frame then your closing speed is ideal for docking.
At other places on the fram you could see '^', 'v', '<' or '>' symbols.
These symbols indicate that your horizontal or vertical velocity is too
high for a successful docking.


Ams_DownAxis

  This instrument provides a graphic depiction  +-------------------------+
of the vehicle as if you were directly above    |    LOOKING   DOWN       |
it and looking directly through it to the       | +------west|----------+ |
ground.  The 'U' symbol shows the relative      | |          f          |n|
angle of the up face, the 'F' symbol shows the  | |                     |o|
relative angle of the front face and the 'L'    | |                     |r|
symbol shows the relative angle of the left     | |                     |t|
face.  If any of these symbols are closer to    | |                     |h|
the ground in relation to the local horizon     |--L         U          --|
plane then they will appear as lowercase,       |s|                     | |
whereas if these faces are closer to the        |o|                     | |
imaginary observer than the local horizon plane |u|                     | |
then they will appear in uppercase. The 'west', |t|                     | |
'east', 'north', and 'south' edges of the       |h|                     | |
display depict the local lunar directions.      | +----------|east------+ |
  The example display indicates that the front  +-------------------------+
face is facing directly westward, the left face is facing directly south
and the up face is pointing directly away from the lunar surface.

Ams_LandingRadar

  The landing radar displays information pertinant to       +-------------+
landing.  A graphics depiction of the lunar topography      |    land     |
below the lander will show in the display.  Near the top    | +---w|----+ |
left and right edge if there are '+' indicators this        | |         | |
indicates that the downward velocity of the LM is too high  | |         |n|
for landing.  If on the top right edge of the display there |--         --|
is a '^' flag showing, this indicates that the LM is moving |s|         | |
too quickly to the west for a safe landing.  On the bottom  | |         | |
right edge if there is a 'v' flag showing, this indicates   | +----|e---+ |
that the LM is moving too quickly eastwards for a safe      +-------------+
landing.  On the right edge near the bottom if there is a '>' flag, this
indicates that the LM is moving too quickly nortwards to land safely and
on the left edge near the bottom if there is a '<' flag then the LM is
moving too quickly southwards for a safe landing.  The various velocity
warning flags will only show if the landing radar is on, the altitude of
the LM is below 18,000 meters and the LM is upright enough for the 
landing radar to be receiving a signal.


Ams_Lm

  This instrument displays information about the LM.  The only     +------+
data it displays is the amount of rock currently loaded onto the   |    lm|
LM.  The RK display indicates how many kilograms of samples have   |--:   |
been loaded.                                                       |--:   |

Ams_Lrv

  This group of displays shows information about the rover.  BAT   +------+
shows what percentage of battery life remains.  BOX shows how many |^  lrv|
sample boxes are left and ROK indicates how many kilograms of      |BAT:99|
samples are currently carried on the rover.  The rover carries     |BOX: 8|
one sample box at a time and each sample box can hold up to 30     |ROK: 0|
kilograms of samples.  A '^' flag will appear in the upper left    +------+
corner of this gauge to indicate that the rover has been unpacked and setup
ready for use.  If this '^' flag is absent then the rover is still packed
away in the descent module.


Ams_Message

  This is the message display area for the onboard        +---------------+
sequencer.  When the sequencer is active performing a     |----------:    |
task the task and how many seconds left will be displayed +---------------+
on this instrument.


Ams_Pilot

  This shows where the pilot is current located.  An  +-------------------+
'*' symbol will be displayed next to the location     | CSM|*LM | LRV| EVA|
where the pilot is located.  The possible locations   +-------------------+
are CSM=Command Service Module, LM=Lunar Module, LRV=Lunar Rover and 
EVA=Outside any vehicle.


Ams_Plss

  This area displays information related to the PLSS, Portable     +------+
Life Support System.  OXY indicates what % of oxygen remains.      |^ plss|
BAT shows what % of battery power remains and PAK indicates how    |OXY:99|
many PLSS recharge packs are left.  If there are no packs left     |BAT:99|
then you will no longer be able to equip the PLSS.                 |PAK: 4|
