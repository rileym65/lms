Features:
---------
  - Damage from hard landing
  - Orient faces properly upon landing
  - Lunar topography
  - Oxygen use from increased metabolic rate
  - Change 3d model for spacecraft orientation to use roll,pitch,yaw angles
    instead of current transformation matrix method
  - Damage to rover for driving too fast over rough ground
  - Damage to pilot for moving too fast over rough ground

Bugs:
-----
  - Larger crater rims need some work, they shift as you move
  - Apparent large shift in position during descent that do not 
    correlate with delta movements


Done, but needs further testing:
--------------------------------
  - Fix bug where after moving on the surface for awhile bad data starts 
    appearing on the map displays.
