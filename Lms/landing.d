	Landing on the Moon is a challenging endeaver.  This manual
	will teach what you need to know and how to become proficient
	at Lunar landings.
[=]
[H2]	Terms
	In order to talk about Lunar landings, it is first important
	to understand the terminology used throughout this and the
	other manuals that accompany this simulator.

[TB]
	| Orbit | - | An orbit is the path taken by a space vehicle
	              around a celestial body.                         |
	| Apolune | - | The highest point above the lunar surface of
	              an orbit                                         |
	| Perilune | - | The lowest point above the surface of an orbit |
	| Inclination | - | The angle that an orbit is tipped in relation
	                    to the equator                              |
	| Node | - | A specific point in an orbit, usually associated
	             with some reference point                          |
	| Ascending Node | - | The point where an orbit crosses the
	             equator going from south to north                  |
	| Descending Node | - | The point where an orbit crosses the
	             equator going from north to south                  |
	| Vector | - | A vector is a mathematical construct that defines
	               both direction and magnitude                     |
	| Prograde | - | A vector that points in the direction
	               of travel                                        |
	| Retrograde | - | A vector that points in the opposite direction
	               of travel                                        |
	| Orbit Normal | - | A vector that points in a direction that is
	               perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.  For this
	               simulation the Orbit Normal will point northerly |
	| Orbit Antinormal | - | A vector that points in a direction that
	               is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.  This
	               vector is the oppose of the Orbit Normal vector  |

[H2]	Lunar Mission

	A Lunar mission is carried out in a number phases:
[=]
[LB]
[LI]	Undocking/Separation
[LI]	Plane Change Maneuvers
[LI]	Descent Orbit Insertion
[LI]	Powered Descent
[LI]	Surface operations
[LI]	Lunar Liftoff
[LI]	Rendevous/Docking
[LE]
[=]
	We will take a look at each of these phases in depth.
[=]
[h1]	Undocking/Separation
	All simulations start with you in the Command/Service Module,
	or CSM for short.  The first step of any mission will be to
	transfer to the Lunar Module, or LM for short.  Once the pilot
	has transferred to the LM, a power up and systems check out
	is performed.
[=]
	One LM power up and checkout is complete the mission is ready
	to continue.  Once the CSM/LM reaches a specific point in their
	orbit the pilot will undock the LM from the CSM and begin
	separation maneuvers.  The separation maneuvers are used to
	move the LM far enough away from the CSM so that thruster jets
	or engine exhause do not damage the CSM as well as to remove
	the risk of collision during maneuvring.
[=]
[H1]	Plane Change Maneuvers
	When the LM is sufficiently far from the CSM it is time to modify
	the LM's orbit to align for landing.  The LM starts in a near
	equitoral orbit and it is necessary to modify both the inclination
	and ascending node to correspond to the target landing site.
